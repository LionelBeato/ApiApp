# API App

Simple .NET app to toy around with how APIs are handled in the framework. 

## Roadmap

- Add frontend that autogenerates a model
- Add service layer
- Add tests


## Current Issues

- `OnModelCreating()` seeding method doesn't seem to work
- There should be a more elegant way to reference relationships via the API request
